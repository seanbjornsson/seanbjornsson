- 👋 Hi, I’m Sean Björnsson!
- 👀 I’m interested in climbing mountains and solving problems with software. Always seeking that outside/inside balance 😸.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning [ViewComponent](https://viewcomponent.org/) as combined with [Hotwire](https://hotwired.dev/). Next I want to learn Sorbet and Typescript for a fully typed, server side rendering, RoR stack.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on tech stack discussions. If you were to build a new app (meant for production, not your side project) tomorrow, what tech stack would you use? Why?
- 📫 Feel free to connect on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/seanbjornsson/) if you want to collaborate!
